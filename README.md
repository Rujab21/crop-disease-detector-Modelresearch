## Contents
- **Jupyter Notebooks** â€“ Training and evaluation experiments  
- **Model Comparison** â€“ Accuracy, loss curves, confusion matrices  
- **Documentation** â€“ Detailed report comparing:
  - MobileNetV2  
  - EfficientNetB3  
  - ConvNeXt-Tiny
     
## Model Research  

We compared three models: **MobileNetV2**, **EfficientNetB3**, and **ConvNeXt-Tiny**.  

### Key Findings  
- **Cotton & Rice** â†’ EfficientNetB3 performed best, with higher accuracy and less overfitting.  
- **Sugarcane** â†’ MobileNetV2 outperformed EfficientNetB3 due to heavy dataset imbalance.  
- **General Case** â†’ EfficientNetB3 is usually better for balanced datasets, while MobileNetV2 handles imbalance better in the short term.  
- **ConvNeXt-Tiny** â†’ Showed strong performance on imbalanced datasets (like sugarcane), with less overfitting and higher robustness.

## Future Work
- Expand dataset with more crop types  
- Experiment with data augmentation techniques  
- Hyperparameter tuning for further accuracy improvements
